I’m going to use this blog for short informational posts: quick runbooks, lab lessons learned, and small security notes I want to remember.

## What to expect

- Short posts with practical takeaways
- Commands, configs, and checklists
- Updates to homelab builds and projects

## Quick example: check what’s listening

```bash
sudo ss -lntp
```

That’s it. More soon.
