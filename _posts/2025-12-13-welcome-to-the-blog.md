I’m going to use this blog for short informational posts: quick runbooks, lab lessons learned, and small security notes I want to remember.

## What to expect

- Short posts with practical takeaways
- Commands, configs, and checklists
- Updates to homelab builds and projects

## Quick example: make sure everything is up-to-date

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Another example: checking disk usage

```bash
df -h
```
This will show you how much disk space is used and available on your filesystems.

## One more: checking memory usage

```bash
free -h
```
This command gives you a quick overview of your system's memory usage.
## Stay tuned for more posts like these. I’ll be adding content regularly to help document my homelab journey and share useful tips with others.
