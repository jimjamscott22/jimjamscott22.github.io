# About Jamie

Curious, technical, and usually building or breaking something in the homelab.

<div class="about-grid">
  <div class="about-copy">
    <p>I like practical security, network tinkering, and lightweight automation. This site is the public scratchpad for what is running, what broke, and what might get deployed next.</p>

    <h2>Stack & tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>pfSense, VLANs, WireGuard/Tailscale</li>
      <li>Linux, Docker, k3s, IaC in Ansible/Terraform lite</li>
      <li>Prometheus, Grafana, simple scripts in Python/Bash</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Focus areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeatable network/security baselines for the lab</li>
      <li>Small services with observability baked in</li>
      <li>Reducing toil with scripts and playbooks</li>
    </ul>
